# Weather App v0.1.2

> Simple weather app using [create-react-app] in [CodeSandbox].

## Assignment

Develop a weather application with the following specifications:

-   [ ] It should show the 5-day weather forecast for Dallas, TX.
-   [ ] Your application should utilize ReactJS (usage of boilerplates such as Create React App are
        encouraged).
-   [ ] You should be able to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
-   [ ] It should match the provided comp as closely as possible on desktop.
-   [ ] We do not provide a mobile mockup as you will determine how that functions on your own.
-   [ ] Icons should correspond to proper weather conditions.
-   [ ] It should be responsive, rendering appropriately on tablet, and handheld form factors.
-   [ ] Your application may use any open weather API.
-   [ ] Your application should showcase one animation technique of your choosing in order to give the
        application some life.
-   [ ] _(Optional)_ Allow for user input to change location of forecast (city, state, or zip)
